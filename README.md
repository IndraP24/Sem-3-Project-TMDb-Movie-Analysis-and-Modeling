# Sem-3-Project-TMDb-Movie-Analysis-and-Modeling

### Abstract:

In this machine learning project, we cleaned, analyzed, and predicted two target variables â€“ both **revenue**
(numerical) and **profitability** (categorical), from the dataset of ***THE MOVIE DATABASE (TMDb).* **

### Aim: 

To explore the various Data Processing, Analysis and Regression and Classification Modeling
techniques required for our Dataset to provide better predictions of the Revenue or the Profitability of
a movie before its production.

### Dataset:

The dataset contains around 5000 movies with 22 features and is obtained from Kaggle [1].
The information available about each movie include its budget, revenue generated, genres, rating, vote
count, popularity, actors and actresses and any more. However, we used an unclean version of the dataset
for our project.

### Implementation:

In this project, we will use this dataset to **clean, analyze and determine** whether any information about
a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. We will then attempt to predict whether a movie's
revenue will exceed its budget (profitability). Also, we will test **two** different models for each
prediction to check which predicts our target variable better.


The results obtained from this project will be helpful for the *Movie Production Teams* to analyze the
rubrics of their Movie Idea before it moves on to the Production Phase.
